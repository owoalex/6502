# 6502
Basic MOS 6502 emulator for linux
## Compiling
I reccomend you install VASM if you want to compile your own assembly code. Otherwise all you need is gcc.
## What does it support?
It supports all the instructions of the original MOS 6502 microprocessor, but has no real outputs or inputs. It's essentially just a glorified turing machine at this point.
